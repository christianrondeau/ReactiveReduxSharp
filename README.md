# Reactive Redux Sharp

A small library that provides [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) architecture using the [Reactive.Net](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive) framework. Very strongly inspired by [ngrx](https://ngrx.io).

This project is *not* suited for production, as it was only built as a showcase.
